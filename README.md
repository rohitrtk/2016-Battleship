# 2016-Battleship

1 player Battleship game that me and my friend Tyler worked on for an assignment in our Grade 11 CS class. 
I made the main class and Tyler made the Battleship class. The player has to try and take out 3 enemy ships 
that have already been placed down inside of the Battleship class.
